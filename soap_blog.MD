## What is Liquid Soap and How to Use It?

When it comes to keeping our hands clean and healthy, liquid soap has become a popular choice among people. But what is liquid soap, and how is it different from bar soap? Liquid soap is a soap that comes in a liquid form and is used to clean our hands and body. Unlike bar soap, which is made by mixing oils and lye and then allowed to cure, liquid soap is made by mixing oils and other ingredients with water and a chemical called potassium hydroxide.

One of the advantages of liquid soap is that it is easy to use and less messy than bar soap. You can dispense a small amount of liquid soap onto your hands, lather it up, and rinse it off with water. Liquid soap is also more hygienic because it comes in a pump bottle or a squeeze bottle, which minimizes the chances of bacteria and germs spreading from one person to another.

Our Bath Salt is a great product to use after washing your hands with liquid soap. It is a muscle relaxing, pain and ache relief bath salt that helps in muscle relaxing, pain relief, improved blood circulation, better circulation, stress relieving, exfoliation, reduces inflammation, detoxifying bath, and luxurious bathing.

## Why Homemade Soap?

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in homemade soap. People are turning towards homemade soap because it is made from natural ingredients and free from harmful chemicals. So, why should you choose homemade soap over commercial ones?

Firstly, homemade soap is made using natural ingredients such as essential oils, herbs, and natural dyes. These ingredients are gentle on the skin and do not strip the skin of its natural oils. Commercial soaps, on the other hand, are made using synthetic fragrances, preservatives, and other harsh chemicals that can irritate the skin and cause allergies.

Secondly, homemade soap is environmentally friendly. Most commercial soaps are made using palm oil, which is linked to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats. Homemade soap, on the other hand, uses sustainable ingredients that do not harm the environment.

Thirdly, homemade soap can be customized to suit individual skin types. For example, if you have sensitive skin, you can make a soap that is gentle and free from fragrances. If you have dry skin, you can add moisturizing ingredients such as shea butter, cocoa butter, or olive oil.

In conclusion, homemade soap is a great alternative to commercial soaps. It is natural, eco-friendly, and customizable to individual skin types. If you are looking for a high-quality homemade soap, check out Pretty Little Things’ range of handmade soaps, including the Honey Oat Soap, Coconut Milk Rose Clay Soap, and Dessert Soaps.

## What Soap is Bad for Skin?

Soap is an essential part of our daily routine. It helps to keep us clean and healthy. However, some types of soap can be bad for our skin. So, what soap is bad for skin?

The first type of soap that is bad for skin is antibacterial soap. Antibacterial soap contains triclosan, which is a chemical that can disrupt the endocrine system and harm the environment. Additionally, overuse of antibacterial soap can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The second type of soap that is bad for skin is soap that contains sulfates. Sulfates are harsh chemicals that are used to create lather. They can strip the skin of its natural oils, leaving it dry and irritated. Sulfates can also cause skin allergies and other skin problems.

The third type of soap that is bad for skin is soap that contains synthetic fragrances. Synthetic fragrances can cause allergies, headaches, and other health problems. They can also irritate the skin and cause rashes.

In conclusion, soap that contains triclosan, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances can be bad for our skin. It is important to choose soap that is free from these harmful ingredients. If you are looking for a soap that is gentle on the skin and free from harmful chemicals, check out Pretty Little Things’ range of handmade soaps, including the Honey Oat Soap, Coconut Milk Rose Clay Soap, and Dessert Soaps.

## Why Soap is Disease-Preventing?

Soap is a disease-preventing essential. Germs are easily spread through contact with infected surfaces, and washing your hands with soap and water can prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. Soap molecules have two ends: one that attracts water and the other that repels water. When soap is used with water, it lifts dirt and germs from the skin and suspends them in water, which can be easily washed away. Our Honey Oat Soap, made with all-natural ingredients, gently cleanses and moisturizes, leaving your skin healthy and germ-free.

## Why Soap Cannot Be Used in Hard Water?

Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium that react with soap to form insoluble compounds, making it difficult for the soap to dissolve and create suds. This can lead to soap scum and buildup on skin and surfaces. Our Bath Salt, made with muscle-relaxing and pain-relieving ingredients, can be used in hard water to provide a luxurious and detoxifying bath experience.

## Why Soap Can Dissolve Oily Substances?

Soap molecules have a hydrophilic (water-loving) end and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) end. This allows them to lift and dissolve oily substances from the skin or surfaces. Our Coffee Cheesecake Soap, made with nourishing cocoa butter, shea butter, and mango butter, can dissolve and cleanse oily substances from the skin, leaving it refreshed and moisturized.

## Why does soap dry out?

This can lead to dryness and irritation, especially for those with sensitive skin.

Pretty Little Things Bath Salt is a great option for those looking for a luxurious and hydrating bath experience.

## Why does soap solution appear cloudy?

Soap solution can appear cloudy due to the presence of tiny air bubbles or impurities in the water used to make the solution. These impurities can include minerals, salts, or organic matter, which can cause the soap molecules to clump together and form visible clusters. Additionally, soap molecules themselves can be suspended in the water, giving the solution a milky appearance. However, a cloudy soap solution does not necessarily indicate that the soap is ineffective or of poor quality.

## Why does soap remove dirt?

Soap molecules are made up of two parts: a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. The hydrophobic tail repels water and is attracted to oils and dirt, while the hydrophilic head is attracted to water. When soap is applied to a surface, the hydrophobic tail attaches to dirt and oil, lifting it away from the surface. The hydrophilic head then surrounds the dirt and oil, creating tiny droplets that can be rinsed away with water. This process, called emulsification, allows soap to effectively remove dirt and oil from surfaces.

## Why use sugar soap?

Sugar soap is a type of cleaning solution used to remove grease, grime, and dirt from surfaces before painting or wallpapering. It gets its name from the fact that it contains sugar, which acts as a mild abrasive to help remove stubborn stains and marks.

## Why is Pears soap transparent?

Pears soap is transparent because it contains glycerin, which is a natural byproduct of the soap-making process. Glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts moisture to the skin, and it also helps to keep the soap moist and pliable. Pears soap is made using a unique process that involves heating the ingredients until they become transparent, which is why it has a distinctive appearance. This soap is gentle on the skin and does not contain harsh chemicals or artificial fragrances, making it a popular choice for people with sensitive skin.

## Why does soap need to cure?

Soap needs to cure because it is made using a chemical reaction called saponification, which converts oils and fats into soap and glycerin. During the saponification process, the soap mixture becomes hot and undergoes a chemical change. After the soap is poured into molds, it needs to be left to cure for several weeks so that it can dry and harden. This process allows excess water to evaporate and ensures that the soap is mild and long-lasting. Cured soap is also less likely to dissolve quickly in water, which means that it lasts longer and provides better value for money.

## Why was Lifebuoy soap banned in the US?

Lifebuoy soap was banned in the US because it contained triclocarban, which is a chemical that has been linked to hormone disruption and antibiotic resistance. Triclocarban is an antibacterial agent that was commonly used in soaps and other personal care products to kill germs and prevent infections. However, recent studies have shown that triclocarban can have harmful effects on human health and the environment. In 2016, the US FDA issued a ban on triclocarban and 18 other antibacterial ingredients in over-the-counter soaps and washes, citing a lack of evidence that they are safe and effective.

##  How Does Soap Expire?

Like most products, soap also has an expiration date. The main reason soap expires is that the natural oils and fats used in soap making can go rancid over time, making the soap ineffective.

Pretty Little Things Bath Salt is an excellent example of a soap with a shorter expiration date.

## How soap was discovered?

Soap was first discovered by ancient Babylonians around 2800 BC when they noticed that combining animal fat with wood ash and water resulted in a substance that could clean textiles. This discovery was refined by the ancient Egyptians, who added oils and fragrances to their soaps for a more pleasant scent. The Greeks and Romans continued to improve soap production, but it wasn't until the Middle Ages that soap became a widespread commodity. Today, soap is an essential item in households worldwide.

##  How soap was made in the old days?

In the old days, soap was made using a simple process that involved only a few ingredients. The first step was to mix animal fat, such as tallow or lard, with a solution of lye and water. The mixture was then boiled in a large pot until it thickened and became soap. The soap was then poured into molds and left to harden for several weeks. Once it was hardened, the soap was cut into bars and left to dry for several more weeks.

Today, soap making has become more complex, with a wide variety of ingredients and techniques available. However, Pretty Little Things still use the traditional handmade process to make their soap. Their soaps are made without preservatives and expire in 6 months. Try their luxurious and unique soaps such as the rose clay soap, made with coconut milk and rose clay that nourishes and softens the skin, or the blueberry waffle soap that is made with cocoa butter, shea butter, and mango butter, making it gentle on the skin.
